			<p>The Cookie DoughJo was founded by Regina Dark, an Arizona native and ASU graduate. Regina has long had a passion for baking which was passed onto her from her mother. Almost two years ago shortly after the birth of her second child, she envisioned creating a unique experience for children that leveraged her passion for baking <strong>Cookies</strong>.</p>

			<p>This vision is being realized in the form of The Cookie DoughJo in Peoria Arizona. We aspire to have a fun and enriching experience for children of all ages with a tangible reward at the end in the form of delicious cookies. We aim to reinforce skills learned at school in a practical setting through baking. For example; reading, the ability to follow directions, math, unit conversion, and chemistry to name a few.</p>

			<p>Thank you for visiting our site. We are looking forward to launching our business in May 2014 and providing a great experience with lasting memories for our guest.
